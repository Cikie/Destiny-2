    <p> Spread your wings and set the sky ablaze.
    <br>
        A young—by Warlock standards—apprentice holds out a hand and reaches for flame. Nothing. The wizened teacher laughs. “You're supposed to be teaching me. Not laughing.”
    <br>
        The teacher's arm extends as one word hangs in the air, “Sword.” As quickly as it appeared, the blade vanishes. “That doesn't help.”
    <br>
        “Sword.” In a flash, the blade appears again, this time at the student's throat. Both pairs of eyes widened. One aghast, one aglow. “Say it with me.”
    <br>
         Two voices ring: “Sword.”
    <br>
        A blade appears in each outstretched hand. A pair of wings form on each Warlock's back. Two Warlocks take flight and vow to never again look down.

        "Warlocks may be thinkers, but most I know can hold their own."
         — Lord Shaxx
        Warlocks were the first to tap into the power of the Traveler, wielding its Light as they ventured beyond the safety of the Wall. They know that each discovery offers new possibilities,[2] and they have devoted themselves to understanding the Traveler, its power and how to better channel it. A Warlock's mind is an arsenal of deadly secrets, balanced between genius and madness. On the battlefield, those secrets can seem to shatter reality itself.[3] They search the frontier to find a means to defeat the Darkness once and for all.[4]

        Warlocks are known for pushing the boundaries of knowledge, even into dangerous territory. At least two warlocks, Toland, the Shattered and Osiris, were exiled for studying the Hive and Vex too closely. There also exists an order of warlocks called the Thanatonauts, who take advantage of Guardians ability to resurrect themselves to receive visions every time they die.[5]

    They are equipped with suits of powered armor that boost their strength and endurance. Titans utilize their strength and skill with firearms to kill their enemies.

    Titans have long honed the Light of the Traveler, passing these skills to each new generation of warrior. Their strength gave birth to the City, and they have taken a blood oath to ensure it will always stand strong.[1] The Wall surrounding the City was built by the first Titans, who also perished defending it.[2] Steadfast and suresighted, Titans face any challenge head-on, serving as living, blunt force instruments of the Traveler’s will.[3]

    <br> Hunters were once survivors that roamed the wastelands and wilderness making their own luck. Through manipulation of the Traveler's energies, Hunters learned how to survive in the wild.[3] This heritage has led to their characteristic tendency of bending the rules to suit their particular situation.

    Though Hunters prefer working alone, others see the value of working with other Guardians as part of a fireteam. Some fear them as being too reckless and dangerous, but their bravery has led to many discoveries dating back to the Golden Age.[3]
