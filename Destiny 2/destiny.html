        Dive into Savathûn's twisted throne world to uncover the mystery of how she and her Lucent Hive stole the Light. Learn the secrets required to craft all-new weapons, a new weapon archetype, and survive the truth within a realm of lies.

    <p class="sa">Survive the Truth</p>
    <br>
        Sister of Shapes, Sword-Breaker, Witch Queen – which of my many names lives on your lips as you weave your story around me? Even as you tread carefully through my courtyard, among those who worship the Light I have gifted, would you deny me the virtue of this power?

        Your answers are telling, Guardian. Ponder them and question those who promise you clarity in the face of all you see here. Listen as their voice wavers. And as you lift your new steel from the heart of your forge, ask yourself, “What force wields you?”

        I await you, Guardian. Step into my Throne World and behold the truth.

        "Warlocks may be thinkers, but most I know can hold their own."
       — Lord Shaxx
    <br>
         Warlocks were the first to tap into the power of the Traveler, wielding its Light as they ventured beyond the safety of the Wall. They know that each discovery offers new possibilities,[2] and they have devoted themselves to understanding the Traveler, its power and how to better channel it. A Warlock's mind is an arsenal of deadly secrets, balanced between genius and madness. On the battlefield, those secrets can seem to shatter reality itself.[3] They search the frontier to find a means to defeat the Darkness once and for all.[4]
    <br>

        Warlocks are known for pushing the boundaries of knowledge, even into dangerous territory. At least two warlocks, Toland, the Shattered and Osiris, were exiled for studying the Hive and Vex too closely. There also exists an order of warlocks called the Thanatonauts, who take advantage of Guardians ability to resurrect themselves to receive visions every time they die.[5]

         A young—by Warlock standards—apprentice holds out a hand and reaches for flame. Nothing. The wizened teacher laughs. "You're supposed to be teaching me. Not laughing."
    <br>

        The teacher's arm extends as one word hangs in the air, "Sword." As quickly as it appeared, the blade vanishes. "That doesn't help."
    <br>

        "Sword." In a flash, the blade appears again, this time at the student's throat. Both pairs of eyes widened. One aghast, one aglow. "Say it with me."
    <br>

        Two voices ring: "Sword."
    <br>

        A blade appears in each outstretched hand. A pair of wings form on each Warlock's back. Two Warlocks take flight and vow to never again look down.

    <br>
        The streets were chaos. We fell under Cabal bullets and blades; red was the color of the day. Everywhere, red. Darkness found me three times that day and each time Ghost woke me, I woke to ever more red. I looked to the sky, but even there I saw nothing but the red reflection of a civilization burning to ash. Hope faded with the last of my Light; this was where I would meet my final death.

        A flash of violet pulled my eyes from down sight. A Cabal ship careened out of the smoke, burning black-indigo. And I saw her, riding the wing, but she was gone in a blink as the ship smashed into the earth. She reappeared in the middle of a legion, and in a second half-heartbeat, rose into the air and dropped an explosion of void the likes of which I'd never seen.

        I had believed I was a Voidwalker... until I beheld Ikora Rey.

    <br>
        The hurricane battered me with a ferocity beyond any foe I had met, battered harder than the roiling chaos in my mind that drove me here, to the ends of the system, in search of—

        "Calm," whispered the Voidwalker. "Burn!" roared the Sunsinger. All I could hear was the impassive voices of my teachers, encouraging me (ordering me?) to find my path, find it soon, no matter the risk, because we can never know when it will all be taken away again, when the storm will overtake us. Words, buffeting me like the hail that pelted my face as I pushed through the howling winds, forced my way through to the eye of—

        Peace.

        The stillness of the hurricane's eye prickled my skin and brought with it realization. We don't have to choose between the calm and the storm. In fact, to have either, we must have both.

        That was the day I first called the storm.

        I first heard it in the Thrall-carved tunnels on Callisto as I saw Light torn from my friend: a chaotic chime like breaking glass, ringing in the corners of my mind. I ignored it then and burned the Hive vermin with vengeance and fire.

        But it returned when Ghaul's wicked contraption gripped the Traveler and the Light fled from my bones: a cold chorus in my ears, a shattered song demanding to be heard. I clung to it then, shivering in the rubble of the Last City. It drowned out the marching of Centurions and focused my will to survive.

        It was in the shadow of the Pyramid on Europa that I finally understood. What was noise became a chilling harmony born of dissonance, a structure I could finally grasp. I joined the song, and as my voice perfected the chord my hands gripped a staff of ice—chaos given shape. It sealed my hands in rime, and the song resonated through my flesh. I was its instrument, and it was mine; when we sang "be still" to the world, it would obey.

        They are equipped with suits of powered armor that boost their strength and endurance. Titans utilize their strength and skill with firearms to kill their enemies.

        Titans have long honed the Light of the Traveler, passing these skills to each new generation of warrior. Their strength gave birth to the City, and they have taken a blood oath to ensure it will always stand strong.[1] The Wall surrounding the City was built by the first Titans, who also perished defending it.[2] Steadfast and suresighted, Titans face any challenge head-on, serving as living, blunt force instruments of the Traveler’s will.[3]

        I'm shaking, hands on my knees, panting. Let the monsters come. Let them come forever. Let them climb the piled bodies of their dead. I don't care. That's the thing I do better than anyone. Not care. Let them come in their hundreds and every one will die at my feet. I don't care about their homing rockets, their exotic matter slugs, their blades from another dimension.

        I don't care because I cannot be moved. I am the wall against which the Darkness breaks.

        Malphur can turn his gun to fire and Shinobu can dance with lightning, but when the horrors run out of the dark, I am the one who does not move.

        I am a wall. And walls don't move. Because walls don't care.

        You'd think the problem with showing up empty-handed to a gunfight would be the bullets. And yes, turning a gunfight into a fistfight is an awful lot of work, tactically speaking, but really I just don't have the patience for all the hiding, and all the fumbling for batteries or flechettes or whatever when it's time to reload, which seems to happen the moment I start to enjoy myself.

        Hiding and reloading. Hiding and reloading. Sounds amazing; you all have fun. My fists don't need reloading.

        Back to the problem. The problem with fists is hygiene. Paint your armor fist to shoulder in alien ichor, toxic robotic lubricant, and ashes. Now take a good look at yourself. That's the only reason I envy the hiders and the reloaders. They get to stay clean.

        The Hammer fell upon the horde in such numbers as to blind the eye and burn the soul. Our phalanx broke their front lines and incinerated the Thrall that reinforced their flank. I looked around the battlefield with pride upon the scores of once-disparate Guardians united to expel the Hive from our backyard. The Honor of Cormorant would win this day because of differences set aside and alliances hard-struck.

        Alas, we both know how that day truly ended. Our early fortunes would be our doom. Green fire and failure would be your sole remembrance of that day.

        But I remember different. I saw an alliance forged in the heat of the Sunbreakers' luminescence despite your opposition. That is what I remember.

        If our flame should one day flicker and die, let it be to set your history ablaze.

        The ground ruptured and sizzled as Scorch Cannons and Wire Rifles pummeled my cover from all directions. Fallen war cries echoed through their endless ranks; despair grew within me, but with it came a whisper. An offer. I closed my eyes and accepted.

        The cold embraced me, dimming the sounds of battle into reverberant echoes, thin and distant. I flexed my gauntlets and felt the roar of glaciers grinding against the bones of the world.

        I crashed my fists into the earth and frozen obelisks erupted, encasing Dregs and Vandals into helpless effigies. I gazed through the crystals enveloping my enemies, and in the myriad refractions, I saw their fear. I felt their desperate will to escape my grip, and in the moment before release, I shattered it.

    <br> Hunters were once survivors that roamed the wastelands and wilderness making their own luck. Through manipulation of the Traveler's energies, Hunters learned how to survive in the wild.[3] This heritage has led to their characteristic tendency of bending the rules to suit their particular situation.

        Though Hunters prefer working alone, others see the value of working with other Guardians as part of a fireteam. Some fear them as being too reckless and dangerous, but their bravery has led to many discoveries dating back to the Golden Age.[3]

        No one remembers who the first Arcstrider was. Hardly anyone remembers the Arcstrider at all. Time vanished us like it does memories.
        But in the darkest days of the Dark Ages, when humanity was utterly defenseless, Arcstriders disciplined their bodies to let the Traveler's energy flow through them, to call lightning itself to hand and wield it like a staff against the Darkness.
        Become the Lightning, they said.

        No.

        The Kell is screaming three inches from my face and its breath smells like two corpses in summer and I have to blink my eyes against the spit. One of the less obvious perks of being able to pull a flaming gun out of the air is enjoying moments like this—alien fist around my neck, feet kicking in the air, not two seconds from death—but ready to laugh at the expression on that Kell's four-eyed face as its mandibles click for the last time and its body turns into fire.
    <br>
    <br>

        The giant creature pulls back its other fist and its steel muscles bunch. I reach for the Light and get… nothing? Huh. Right. I used my flaming gun on those three Taken outside the obelisk. Gotta learn to count.

        The Bladedancers deride us as slow. The Gunslingers say we lack precision. “How is that better than a knife?” “How is that better than a flaming pistol?” Well.
    <br>

        My boots sink inches into the ground with every step. My rebreather filters the stench out of the air, but my eyes sting like I'm showering with battery acid.
    <br>

        “We're almost there,” my Ghost chirps. My jaw clenches. I know we're almost there, Little Light.
    <br>

        This vile marsh opens to reveal a black cave's maw. Inside, an infinite number of little green eyes flicker like bad stars. CRACK! I fire a single bullet into the air and the horde in the cave shrieks and runs out.
    <br>

        “This is it, you two.” The Warlock and Titan leap from the bog behind me. A bow appears in my hands and I let a single binding shot loose from the shadow.
    <br>

        Now there are Orbs of Power everywhere. Eat, my friends. Eat.

        A Fallen Captain stalks his prey through the barrens of Europa, Servitor at his back. The wind kicks up shimmering plumes of frost; he doesn't see the frozen kama hurtling towards him. It strikes with a deafening crack; the Servitor is gone. The Captain flees for cover, but it's too late — he is frozen in a crystalline prison.
    <br>

        His battle cry freezes in his throat; there is only deafening silence. He sees a shadow approaching, cloaked in the ice and whirling snow, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared. Fear grips him as he scans the white wastes.
    <br>

        A second kama pierces the ice shelf. Biting whirlwinds erupt and tear at his frozen body. He catches a glimpse of the shadow in the squall, rifle in hand. The hunt has ended; he shatters in the wind.
